    FizzBuzz is the name of the game.
    Here's a list of numbers.
    Send me back a string as follows:
    For each number:
    If it is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
    If it is divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
    If it is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
    Otherwise, print the number.

    Each entry in the string should be separated by a space.

    For example, if the numbers are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], you would send back:

    {
      "answer": "1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz"
    }
  rules:
  - number: 3
    response: Fizz
  - number: 5
    response: Buzz
  numbers:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3
  - 4
  - 5
  - 6
  - 7
  - 8
